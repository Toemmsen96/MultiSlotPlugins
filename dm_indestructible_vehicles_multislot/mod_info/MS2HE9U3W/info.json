It's still possible to crash with enough force that parts will go inside out (ex. part of a bumper may be inside out after a hard crash)\n\n- This does not make things [I]impossible[\/I] to break. It's still possible to break sensitive parts. Some vehicles may especially be prone to this.\n\n- This does not change vehicle rigidity. If you go into slow motion, the vehicle will be incredibly wobbly as more force is now distributed throughout the entire vehicle\n\n- This does not prevent instabilities. In fact, it makes them happen even more for a similar reason as the above point.\n\n- Vehicles will become incredibly bouncy for a similar reason as the above points\n\n- This does not change node\/beam counts. There is no performance gain using this, despite the \"degraded experience\"\n[B][\/B]",
